<p>In this article, we will look at how to structure a 1-page README file that you must provide for each and every software project you embark on from now on. Be it a short library or a complex code base, you owe it to your users (and yourself) to provide a minimum set of instructions that allow users to see, in a few minutes, what your code does, how to get it to work (compilation and/or installation), and finally, how to use it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the end of this article, you will have internalised the proven structure of a 1-page readme file that should be used for each project. You can adapt it to your project needs, but the presented sections are the bare minimum that you need to document code. We will also look at the most popular markup language used to write technical documentation, which is called Markdown. You will see that with a minimum set of instructions, you are able to write rich and beautiful technical documentation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After looking at the basics of Markdown editing, we apply that knowledge to write the missing 1-page README files for our previously developed <a href="https://cfd.university/learn/how-to-compiler-write-and-use-cfd-libraries-in-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">linear algebra solver</a> and <a href="https://cfd.university/learn/the-complete-guide-to-structured-and-unstructured-mesh-reading-using-cgns" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">mesh reader</a> libraries.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-introduction">Introduction to documentation markup</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In our <a href="https://cfd.university/learn/keep-your-users-happy-how-to-document-code-the-right-way/documenting-code-why-bother-and-how-to-do-it-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">last article</a>, we looked at different types of documentation and mentioned that we have essentially three types to choose from: the 1-page readme file, the user guide, and the annotated code documentation. We will concentrate on the 1-page README file in this article.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to sit down and type out your documentation, we are not just writing text, but for anything longer than a paragraph or so, we want to structure the text with section titles and sub-headings. If we want to show specific code snippets and comment on them, then we require some support to render the code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For our purposes, we are interested in writing CFD solvers and related libraries, so we may also want to show some equations. Later, we want to show some references and link back to them, and perhaps show some sample output and structure it into a nice table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thinking about all of these use cases (and you may come up with more), the question then arises of how we should write our documentation. We could open up a text editor and start writing away, inventing our own creative syntax, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">ASCII-art-like</a> to separate sections and display tables, but certain things, like equations and displaying images, will not be possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckily, we don't have to reinvent the wheel, and we can make use of solutions others have come up with before us. There exists a plethora of so-called markup languages that allow you to style your text using a specific syntax. The most popular markup languages in use, when it comes to code documentation, are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">reStructuredText</a>. There exist other popular languages, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">wikitext</a>, which, as the name suggests, is used on Wikipedia and related websites to markup text for articles, and you can find an overview of other, less-known, markup languages <a href="https://github.com/mundimark/awesome-markdown-alternatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of these markup languages have one thing in common: they take the annotated text and transfer it into some form of HTML document. A dedicated reader is then required to display your marked-up text. But once again, we don't have to worry about this. If we are using markdown or restructured text, we stand a good chance that our code editor or online repository, where we want to show our documentation, has a dedicated reader already available for us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let us remind ourselves about the structure that we want to follow in our 1-page README file. This is taken from our <a href="https://cfd.university/learn/keep-your-users-happy-how-to-document-code-the-right-way/documenting-code-why-bother-and-how-to-do-it-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">last article</a> in a slightly adapted form, where we discussed different types of documentation approaches:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> This section describes what problem this library or code is solving. The first sentence should be a description that summarises the entire code in a single sentence. Any following sentences may provide additional background and motivations for this library/code.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Installation:</strong> This section shows how to install the library code. For interpreted languages such as Python, this may be as simple as downloading the code from a remote repository such as GitHub, but for compiled languages like C++, it is useful to include instructions on how to build the code, potentially with different instructions for different operating systems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Usage/Examples:</strong> Anything you want your users to be able to do straight away after installing your library/code should be covered by an example with some additional explanations as required. This section should contain all of these examples/tutorials. These may be grouped into sub-sections if you have a few examples to go through.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>References:</strong> Anything you want to reference should go here. These can be reference papers or other libraries that are used.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we will look at how we can use markdown to write documentation of this form. First, we will go through the syntax to learn Markdown, and you will see that it is pretty straightforward to use Markdown for documentation purposes. We also look at badges and how we can use them to quickly convey key aspects of our code. Finally, we will apply this and write two documentations: one for our <a href="https://cfd.university/learn/how-to-compiler-write-and-use-cfd-libraries-in-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">linear algebra solver library</a>, and one for our <a href="https://cfd.university/learn/the-complete-guide-to-structured-and-unstructured-mesh-reading-using-cgns" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">mesh reading library</a> based on the CGNS file format.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-markdown-the-tool-of-choice-for-documentation">Markdown: The tool of choice for documentation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2004, John Gruber created Markdown as a simple but effective way to format text. At the time, formatting was predominantly performed in HTML, but this mixes formatting and text, which is not ideal when writing documentation. The idea behind markdown, and any other markup language, is to provide intuitive markup clues that can be interpreted by the markup interpreter and translated into valid HTML.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The popularity of markup is explained by its extremely easy-to-use syntax. I bet that if you go through the rest of this document and you have never used markdown before, then you will be able to write markdown text, without looking up the syntax over and over again. Most of that is so simple that you will be able to remember it straight away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Markdown is very limited in the things it can display (or markup). This is by design and on purpose. However, Markdown has become the most popular markup language for writing code documentation, and as you might suspect, the more users you have, the more features will be requested. But this goes against the design of Markdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To complicate things further, Markdown does not have an official specification that describes what a valid Markdown document should look like. Gruber himself was <a href="https://stymied.medium.com/why-you-should-and-should-not-use-markdown-1b9d70987792" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">against the idea of standardising Markdown</a>, and so over time, others have taken it upon themselves to define a standard for themselves. As a result, we now have different implementations for Markdown, of which popular implementations are <a href="https://commonmark.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">CommonMark</a>, <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">GitHub-flavoured Markdown</a>, <a href="https://michelf.ca/specs/markdown-extra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Markdown Extra</a>, and <a href="https://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">MultiMarkdown</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to write Markdown for a specific platform, you should ensure that you are writing it with the correct specification in mind. While all of them support what was proposed by Gruber originally, the main difference in these specifications is the additional features that they add. Since this goes against the founding idea of Markdown, you can see why it has never caught support from the inventor himself, and as a result, Markdown itself can be a bit messy at times if you mix up specifications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make things clear, we will be using the GitHub-flavoured Markdown extension, so if you are using a different platform to view your Markdown files, you may see differences. While we will look at the most common use cases, there are quite a few more things you can do, but perhaps you won't need them as often. You can always check out the full Markdown documentation and what is supported in the official <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">GitHub documentation</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the following sub-section, we will look at common Markdown syntax that we want to use when writing documentation, which we can then use to write our 1-page documentation for our existing libraries. For the examples that follow, the Markdown syntax will be displayed on the left and the generated HTML on the right. It will not look exactly as it does on GitHub, nor, perhaps, as in your Markdown viewer, if you are using one; keep this in mind when inspecting the results.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-headings-and-paragraphs">Headings</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The basic building blocks are headings and the paragraphs they contain. Section headings are achieved by using the <code>#</code> symbol in front of the title, and the number of <code>#</code> symbols determines the level of the heading. This is shown below.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tables can be added as well to Markdown, and while they have some limitations in their layout, adding a simple table is not too difficult. We separate columns using the pipe symbol (<code>|</code>), and we separate the header from the data entry with at least three dashes (<code>---</code>). Adding a leading, trailing, or both leading and trailing colon (<code>:</code>) signifies if the text on the respective column should be aligned to the left, right, or centre.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-adding-badges-to-polish-your-documentation">Adding badges to polish your documentation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Badges allow you to showcase what your code can do at a glance. These are commonly added at the top of your README file and can contain things like the software license, current version, whether the latest unit tests have passed, how many downloads your software got, and much more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are dedicated online services for each aspect of your code development, and pretty much all of them provide their own badge that you can use to show how your code is performing. A common example is that of software testing; every time we push a new code change onto our remote repository, where we store our code, it gets built, and our unit tests will be automatically run by an external service. This service will then set the status of your tests, which can be used to dynamically show whether your tests are passing or failing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The website which brings all of these together is <a href="https://shields.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">shields.io</a>. A list of all possible badges is provided on their <a href="https://shields.io/badges">documentation page</a>. For example, if we wanted to show that the current version of our software is 1.2.5, and we are using the permissive MIT license, we can add the following two badges to our README file:</p>

<p>In both cases, we are using static badges here. This means that we can type any 3-word combination after the URL part <code>https://img.shields.io/badge/</code> and it will be transformed into a badge. We use the same syntax we saw above for images and links to display the badges in our Markdown readme file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a very basic usage; I would encourage you to look through the <a href="https://shields.io/badges/static-badge" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">myriad of badges</a> that are available. See which ones interest you and what syntax you need to use to add them to your README file. Most of them will require some form of third-party involvement, and when we look at them in future series, we will get back to these shields and look at how to add them to our documentation file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another good option is to check popular libraries and see which badges they are using. For example, have a look at the C++ <a href="https://github.com/nlohmann/json" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">JSON</a> parsing library, and you will see a number of badges in action. Make it a habit of checking which badges are used by others and how you can incorporate them into your own projects if you feel they would improve your documentation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this point, we have looked at how to write Markdown files. We have also established what structure we want to follow. So let's put this to the test and start writing some basic 1-page readme files that we can add to our <a href="https://cfd.university/learn/how-to-compiler-write-and-use-cfd-libraries-in-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">linear algebra solver library</a> and <a href="https://cfd.university/learn/the-complete-guide-to-structured-and-unstructured-mesh-reading-using-cgns" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">mesh reading library</a>, which we based on the CGNS-file format.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of looking at the comparison between Markdown and the generated output, I'll show the generated output here only. If you want to look at the Markdown files, you can download the updated mesh reading and linear algebra solver library at the beginning of the article, which contains the new README files.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-summary">Summary</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Writing a concise, yet effective 1-page documentation is not difficult, and all it takes is a proven structure with the right markup language to guide the reader through your software project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Markdown is by far the most popular markup language and is used universally by projects, but it does come with some disadvantages, such as no unified standard. This means a Markdown document will only be rendered correctly if the Markdown renderer is following the same standard as the author of the file, and there are many different standards available instead of one provided by the inventor of Markdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At a bare minimum, for every software project that you embark on, be it a simple library or a large code base, you should, at a minimum, provide a 1-page readme file visible to everyone in the root directory of your project. This will be rendered automatically by online version control repositories such as <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">GitLab</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you put up the effort to show users what the purpose (and features) are of your code, how to install it and then how to use it, you will see a much better usage of your code by others. And even if you do not plan to make your code available to others (for now), documenting your code will go a long way for your future self when you try to remember how to compile your code or which functions you need to call in order to achieve the desired outcome.</p>
